Annual Leave Policy Overview
============================

**1. Introduction:**
The Annual Leave Policy is designed to guide the administration of annual leave for all employees of XYZ Corporation. This policy emphasizes the importance of work-life balance and the well-being of our workforce.

**2. Eligibility:**
All full-time and part-time employees who have successfully completed their probationary period of six months are eligible for annual leave benefits. Temporary and contract employees are not covered under this policy.

**3. Accrual of Annual Leave:**
Employees will accrue annual leave based on their length of service. The accrual rate is 1.25 days per month for the first year of service, increasing to 1.5 days per month after the first year. The maximum annual leave balance an employee can accumulate is 30 days.

**4. Requesting Annual Leave:**
Employees are required to submit annual leave requests through the company's HRIS (Human Resources Information System) at least two weeks before the intended leave start date. The request should specify the preferred dates, reason for leave, and any relevant project considerations.

**5. Approval Process:**
Annual leave requests are subject to managerial approval and operational requirements. While we strive to accommodate employee preferences, approval is contingent upon business needs. Managers will respond to leave requests within five business days.

**6. Blackout Periods:**
During peak business periods, such as our annual product launch, blackout periods may be enforced. During these times, employees might face limitations on annual leave approvals.

**7. Carry Over and Forfeiture:**
Employees can carry over up to five days of unused annual leave to the following year. Any unused leave beyond this limit will be forfeited on January 31st of each year.

**8. Pay During Annual Leave:**
While on approved annual leave, employees will continue to receive their regular base salary. However, additional compensation such as performance bonuses or overtime pay will not apply during this period.

**9. Sick Leave Conversion:**
If an employee faces an extended illness and exhausts their sick leave, they can request a conversion of up to five days of their unused sick leave into annual leave. These requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

**10. Public Holidays:**
Public holidays that coincide with an employee's approved annual leave period will not be counted as annual leave days. The employee will receive their regular compensation for these holidays.

**11. Termination of Employment:**
In the event of employment termination, employees will receive compensation for accrued and unused annual leave days up to the termination date.

**12. Special Considerations:**
We recognize that unique circumstances may arise. Employees facing such situations are encouraged to engage in open conversations with their supervisors or the HR department to explore potential accommodations.

**13. Policy Review:**
This Annual Leave Policy is subject to periodic review and adjustment. Any revisions will be communicated to employees, ensuring transparency and adherence to current best practices.

Promoting the well-being of our employees is integral to our organizational ethos. This Annual Leave Policy is structured to foster work-life balance, acknowledging the dual importance of individual rejuvenation and company success.
